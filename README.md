# DevelopingDataProducts
This repo contains my project materials for the Johns Hopkins University Coursera class, Developing Data Products.

The intent of this assignment was to demonstrate ability to build and deploy a Shiny Web App that performed
a calculation of data based on user input. The subject matter is a poor attempt at humor and the function is
not intended to win nobel recognition.
